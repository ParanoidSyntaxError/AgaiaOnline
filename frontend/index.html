                The planet's sun is dying, and civilization is on a constant decline.
                Whispered is the prophecy of a new race of people, that will renew the sun's vitality.
                But there are some who would rather these prophecies be left in scripture, and history 
                <br/><br/>
                A cabal of spiritual elite known as Seer's use their esoteric knowledge of occult and rituals to
                leverage the superstitious fears of the ruling class, and further their unknown agenda.
                But among the wisest elders, and those who seek their wisdom, is rumored a time where the sun
                will be invigorated, by a new group of people, known as Oracles.
                <br/><br/>
                These Oracles will ignite the dying sun, and overthrow the Seer's rule.

                    1. Mint a card
                </div>
                <br/>
                Minting a card costs 2 Chainlink tokens, this card gives you unlimited access to the game. 
                <br/>
                Of the 2 tokens spent on minting, 1 of them will be deposited into your VRF account. 
                <br/><br/>
                <div class="text-medium">
                    2. Mint a character
                </div>
                <br/>
                You can mint as many characters as you want, as long as you have a card in your wallet. 
                <br/>
                However, minting a charcter will deduct a small amount of Chainlink from your VRF account balance
                <br/><br/>
                <div class="text-medium">
                    3. Raid a dungeon
                </div>
                <br/>
                Now try raiding a dungeon with you newly minted character.
                <br/>
                Like minting a charcter, this will also deduct some amount of Chainlink from your VRF account balance
                <br/>
                If this balance ever gets low, you can always top it up by sending some more Chainlink tokens.
                <br/>
                You can withdraw all your Chainlink tokens at anytime.
                <br/><br/>
                <div class="text-medium">
                    4. Top up your VRF account
                </div>
                <br/>
                Overtime your VRF account balance may get too low to mint a new character, or raid a dungeon.
                <br/>
                If this ever happens, you can always top it up by sending some more Chainlink tokens.
                <br/>
                You can withdraw all your Chainlink tokens at anytime.
